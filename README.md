1. An humble VINDICATION Of a Free ADMISSION Unto the Lords-Supper.
I Have ſpoken of the Inſtitution, Nature, and Ends of the Sacrament; I come now to the Receivers, An
      * Objection 1. This Doctrine will take away the uſe of the Keyes, Excommunicate Excommunication, and leave us no Diſcipline in the Church.

Rep. But is not the Ordinance hereby taken in vain againſt the third Commandement?

Rep. But doe We not hereby make
our ſelves one with the wicked with whom we joyne, and can we have Communion with Chriſt and Beliall?

Rep. But were it not abſurd for a man to ſet his ſeal, when there hath been no agreement and tranſactions before? So do unregenerate men, who come to the Sacrament without that ſolemne giving up the Soule to God, as be ought, who enters Covenant with him.

Rep. But what right doth this give him to the Covenant?

Rep. Although a Man may be converted At, it is not By the Sacrament, it is occaſionally, but not intentionally a converting Ordinance.

Rep. But unregenerate men (you will ſay) are dead in their ſins, and ſhall wee give bread to the dead? men muſt firſt be living, new born, and converted Chriſtians, before they can feed at the Sacrament?

Rep. But you will ſay; If another ſhould be taking a cup of poyſon ſhall not we be partakers of his bloud, if we doe not hinder and and forbid him? Qui non vetat, &c.

Rep. But are we not faulty and partake of other mens Sins, if we do not our beſt to have the Leven purgedout, and therefore we may not ſay, Am I my Brothers keeper, look they to it?

Rep. But you will ſay more obviouſly, Are not all ignorant and ſcandalous perſons Swine and Dogs, to be rejected and kept from the Pearls and holy things of the Sacrament?

Rep. But you will ſay, If I muſt decline a wicked man, ſo as not to eat with him, (which I interpret by our ordinary converſation) how much more muſt I decline him at this Sacrament?

      * Object. 2. The moſt of men are wholly unfit, and not capable of this Ordinance. This is enlarged, Here are things to be done; Preparatory, a ſerious examination; Executory, an exerciſe of Faith, Love, &c. And here are things to be received, Remiſſion, Increaſe of Grace, Aſſurance, which all cannot obtaine neither. Therefore no free Admiſſion hither.

Rep. But is not the Ordinance hereby taken in vain againſt the third Commandement?

Rep. But doe We not hereby make
our ſelves one with the wicked with whom we joyne, and can we have Communion with Chriſt and Beliall?

Rep. But were it not abſurd for a man to ſet his ſeal, when there hath been no agreement and tranſactions before? So do unregenerate men, who come to the Sacrament without that ſolemne giving up the Soule to God, as be ought, who enters Covenant with him.

Rep. But what right doth this give him to the Covenant?

Rep. Although a Man may be converted At, it is not By the Sacrament, it is occaſionally, but not intentionally a converting Ordinance.

Rep. But unregenerate men (you will ſay) are dead in their ſins, and ſhall wee give bread to the dead? men muſt firſt be living, new born, and converted Chriſtians, before they can feed at the Sacrament?

Rep. But you will ſay; If another ſhould be taking a cup of poyſon ſhall not we be partakers of his bloud, if we doe not hinder and and forbid him? Qui non vetat, &c.

Rep. But are we not faulty and partake of other mens Sins, if we do not our beſt to have the Leven purgedout, and therefore we may not ſay, Am I my Brothers keeper, look they to it?

Rep. But you will ſay more obviouſly, Are not all ignorant and ſcandalous perſons Swine and Dogs, to be rejected and kept from the Pearls and holy things of the Sacrament?

Rep. But you will ſay, If I muſt decline a wicked man, ſo as not to eat with him, (which I interpret by our ordinary converſation) how much more muſt I decline him at this Sacrament?
