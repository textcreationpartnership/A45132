            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:45851:3"/>and having at length obtained a compleat copy, I could not but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thinke it an engagement, much conducing to the glory of God, to get this precious light, left under a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell in a private auditory, to be ſet up publikely in the candleſtick of the Church, that the ſpirits of many others might be thereby diſclouded from the like ſcruples, that moſt ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder the bleſſed enjoyment of this Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:45851:4"/>That thou wilt paſſe no cenſure upon the Book or Writer, before thou haſt read all over, weighing the whole parts together, and examined them ſeriouſly by the unerring rule of the word of God.

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45851:5"/>They were all ſate at the Table, as they did eat (in the 22.) Jeſus took bread, and gave it them, and ſo likewiſe the Cup (<hi>v.</hi> 23) Saying, <hi>Drinke ye all of it</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27.) And they did ſo ſaith the Text; <hi>They all Dranke of it,</hi> all the twelve without exception; from whence I gather a free Admiſſion to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, this is a poynt we know troubles many, and I do humbly acknowledge my ſelf the weakeſt of a thouſand, to ſatisfie the difficulties of others; yet whereas the apprehenſions, many times, of a playn honeſt meaning Chriſtian, in its pure naturalls (I meane unconfounded with the judgments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) may ſuite better with common underſtandings, than a more learned and elaborate diſquiſition; I ſhall Sincerely lay you downe my very heart and thoughts in this thing, being ready to lye down at the feet of any truly Godly Soule, that either out of tenderneſs of Conſcience, or ſtrength of Reaſon, dare not, or will not, ſubmit unto my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice in it.</p>
               <p>For the managing the poynt, I ſhall breifly lay down my meaning, or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45851:5"/>ſtate of the queſtion, give my Proofs, Reaſons, and Anſwer Objections.</p>
               <p>For my meaning it is honeſt, and very plaine, without reſervation. The Lord Jeſus has a Church in the World, wherein there is a viſible profeſſion of his name; In this Church, God has ſet up his Ordinances of the Word and Sacrament; Of theſe Ordinances, ſome are capable, and ſome uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Thoſe that are uncapable, are ſo, either by Nature, as Infants, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted perſons, or by the Churches cenſure of Excommunication, and no others. For thoſe that are capable, we muſt rightly conſider this capacity, in regard of the Church (or Miniſter) in Admiſſion of them to the Ordinance; or in regard of the Communicants themſelves in coming thither. Now I dare not yet poſitively ſay for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples part, that all are ſo capable that they may come as they liſt (though it be a duty none is excuſed from) becauſe there is a ſolemne preparation requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and many cannot ſeriouſly find in their hearts to enter, or renew their Covenant with Chriſt, whereof this is a pledge if it be not miſuſed. Yet I am
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45851:6"/>humbly perſwaded for the Miniſter and Churches part, (who on Gods behalfe is to offer Chriſt freely, and ſo to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Convenant to all that will receive him) there is ſuch a univerſall capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for all men indefinitely, that if any come in, as profeſſing themſelves rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enter convenant with Chriſt, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo to ſerve him in the worſhip of this Ordinance (the former only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) we are to encourage them, ſaying with the Bride, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever is a Thirſt let him come, whoſoever will, let him come, and drinke freely of theſe waters of Life, or means of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, I do not believe that any, unleſſe firſt excommunicated (<hi>ipſo jure</hi> or <hi>de facto</hi>) ought to be refuſed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of this Sacrament. <hi>They all Dranke of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my proofs; look into <hi>Ex.</hi> 12. we read of the Paſſover, which is the ſame in ſignification with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Speak unto Iſrael, let every man take his Lambe, a Lambe for a houſe. v.</hi> 47. <hi>All the Congregation ſhall obſerve it.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 50. <hi>The whole people did ſo, as the Lord commanded them.</hi> Adde to this 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.5. <hi>They Decreed to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45851:6"/>proclame through all Iſrael from Dan to Beerſheba that they ſhould come and keep the Paſſeover to the Lord.</hi> Here you ſee free Admiſſion without exception. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in <hi>Num.</hi> 9.7. we find a legall pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion keeping ſome back for a month and no longer, as it appears in the 11 <hi>verſe,</hi> which nevertheleſſe was diſpenſable too at the prayer of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 30.18. the reaſon being, becauſe ſuch unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs kept them from the Congregation (a plain type of the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) but as for any ſpirituall pollution whatſoever (which is to be waſhed away with a penitent heart) we read of none that might debarre them from that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. This is that we ſtand upon; As for their legall rights, who knowes not they are aboliſhed? Now the Elder Brother (the Paſſeover) being dead, wee ſhall find the yonger (our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to have poſſeſſion of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this free Adminiſtration. Turne to the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Wee being many are all partakers of one Bread.</hi> All; at <hi>Corinth</hi> there were many it ſeems, came over from Heatheniſme to the Church, and as many as came into them, <hi>All</hi> (this is the very truth) were admitted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45851:7"/>to their Communion.</p>
               <p>But now I pray, what <hi>All</hi> were theſe? ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Flee Idolatry, I ſpeak to you, as men of underſtanding, judge ye what I ſay, is not this Sacrament the Communion of Chriſt, how then can you communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with I dolls?</hi> This is the ſenſe in brief of the whole Chapter; marke it: Theſe <hi>Corinths</hi> were ſuch luke-warm Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that they were ſometimes ready to goe to their Idolls, and ſometimes to Church; like thoſe in the ſecond of <hi>Kings</hi> 17.41. and happily thought it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. Now this Argument <hi>Paul</hi> uſes to reclame them; <hi>Doe we not All par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of one Bread? therefore joyn not with Idolls. As ſoon as you come into us we admit, and joyn with you in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and profeſſion of Chriſt, (who is God) And therefore how can you with ſhame now goe to the Table of Idolls (which are Devills?)</hi> This is very forceable and apparent, That theſe ☞ <hi>Corinths</hi> whilſt they are but willing to profeſs Chriſt, though yet given to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, are admitted with the reſt to the Sacrament, which very thing too, is urged as a means to reclame them from it: Compare this with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45851:7"/>there are the ſame <hi>Corinthians</hi> mutinous and even drunken together at this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; now this certainly was a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation, for which they are reproved and directed to examine, and carry themſelves better for the future; but as for their comming together, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall participation, that was but their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and nothing is, or could be ſaid againſt it. Look back to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. There wee have the whole body of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that paſſed through the Sea and Wilderneſſe, Baptized under the Cloud, and drinking of the ſame Rock, Jeſus Chriſt; that is, admitted free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to both our Sacraments. Take any Chriſtian, and he will be ready to ſay, give me but any place of Scripture, for example of a generall Admiſſion, and I will be convinced; Now here is one expreſſe, where all without exception, even thoſe very ſcandalous ones, with whom God was not well pleaſed, but deſtroyed in the Wilderneſſe (while there was no legall Rites, ſpirituall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe not forbidding any) do freely participate of the outward Signes one with another. Neither is it the ſaying this was a fleeting Ordinance, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45851:8"/>to preſerve their lives, that can abate the ſtrength of this place; For doe we but marke the ſenſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and you ſhall ſee in this very point, and to this very purpoſe does he parallell theſe Types to our Sacraments. The ſcope is this, Theſe <hi>Corinths</hi> were given to Idolatry and many vices, but yet thought well enough of themſelves, being ready to glory of their outward profeſſion, that they were of the Church, baptized, and communicating with Chriſtians: Now the Apoſtle to beat them off from this vaine conceit, tells them plainly, <hi>I would not have you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that All the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>were partakers of both theſe Sacraments, as wel as you, &amp; yet many of them were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed when they ran to I dolls, as you doe; and therefore take heed, and let them be a warning to you; As for theſe outward rites, they are things indeed. all that come to our Church, and profeſſe Chriſt are admitted to, and ſo are ye, but yet think not you ſhall eſcape Gods Iudgments, if you walk not anſwerable to your profeſſion.</hi> The true importance of thoſe words being well weighed, are ſufficient of themſelves to end this controverſie, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45851:8"/>ſenſe of Scripture, and not barely the words being Scripture. Turn to the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Feaſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. with <hi>Luke</hi> 14 16.23. and though parables are not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Argumentative, yet in their main purpoſe they are as enforcing as any Texts beſides; Now if this generall Admiſſion is not a chief thing intended, nay the very ſcope of the parable, judge by theſe particulars,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, In <hi>Luke</hi> there is no other thing added, but the calling of all unto the Feaſt is the main buſineſs there ſet down only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, In <hi>Matth.</hi> where the ſtory goes on to the Wedding garment, unto the Maſters command is added the Servants bringing in all, both Good and Bad. <hi>verſe</hi> the 10th.</p>
               <p n="3">☞ 3. Thirdly, The Lords very excluſion of him that came in to the Feaſt, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts he muſt be needs firſt admitted, and brought in by the Servants, his Sinne conſiſting not in his comming thither; for that he was compelled to doe, (by which I conceive is meant his duty) but in his neglect of putting on his Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment; whereby it appears by his unpreparedneſſe, he had no minde to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45851:9"/>come at all, if he could have help'd it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Our Saviour explains his owne parable, ſignifying here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that many are called, that is the worke of the Miniſtery, we are freely to offer Chriſt in his Ordinances; but few are choſen, that is the work of God, which we leave onely to him. The Servants I ſay ſtill brought the man in, it was the Lord only took upon him to Judge and caſt him out. Now who is that faithfull Steward that gives the houſhold their portion of meat in due ſeaſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.42. but theſe that are thus doing? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. even as <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptizes All that came to him for his Baptiſme, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. to the 11 <hi>verſe,</hi> though at the ſame time ſome of them he calls vipers (<hi>Adultis eadem eſt ratio utriuſque Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti,</hi> ſo that I take this a ſtrong proof) and as the Apoſtles themſelves, that when thouſands are converted at a Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.42. they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately communicate with them, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting freely not only the meat of the word, but bread too of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>See once more, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.28. A pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45851:9"/>place I like for the expreſſion. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> here was very ſcrupulous of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Chriſtian Communion with any but the <hi>Iewes,</hi> It was a pollution under the Law to participate in any thing with the <hi>Gentiles, Io:</hi> 4: But being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by a viſion from Heaven, God hath ſhewed me now, ſayes he, that I ſhould not call any man polluted and unclean; I thank the Lord I have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this ſame Leſſon with a ſatisfyed Conſcience, to eſteem no man unclean, ☞ but all (unleſſe excommunicated) free in the uſe of Gods Ordinances. Adde to theſe proofs the conſideration of ſuch Texts as ſet forth Free grace, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Io.</hi> 6.37. with the like, &amp; tell me when the Goſpel offers Chriſt, or when Chriſt offers himſelf &amp; grace, which are the things ſignified, thus freely to poore ☞ Sinners, how can we have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to turne them away from the Signes and meanes thereof in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For my Reaſons.</hi> The firſt and chiefeſt I draw from the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Sacraments are <hi>Verbum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile,</hi> a viſible Goſpell; A declaring of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45851:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt crucified; A Memoriall of the Covenant made by his death; that is ☞ The Sacraments ſet forth Chriſt to the eye, as the Goſpell does to the ear; the ſame matter is preſented in both, only to divers ſenſes, and therefore the ſame latitude muſt be granted to them both, in their adminiſtration. Upon this ground me thinks I ſtand as upon a Rock, againſt which all Objections, like waves, do but daſh themſelves in pieces. Look into the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. we find Chriſt in the words of Inſtitution, ver. 25. telling us, <hi>The bread is his Body, the Cup is the bloud of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the whole action, an ordinance in remembrance of him.</hi> Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle comments on this in the 26 verſe, <hi>For as oft as you doe it, you doe ſhew forth</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the death of the Lord;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſee plainly what is his judgment of our Saviours Inſtitution, whatſoever you may thinke of it, and that is to be a declaration, ſhewing, or holding forth his death (or Covenant made by his death) unto the Receivers. This word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this annunciation, or ſhewing forth, is taken from the <hi>Jews, Exo.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.26, 27. who were to inſtruct and declare
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45851:10"/>the matter to their children at the Paſſover; ſo Chriſt is here ſhewed forth, as the matter of the Sacrament ſet forth, I may ſay, of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation through Faith in his bloud, to declare his righteouſneſs for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, alike in the Word and Sacrament. You have a place may fully expreſſe this for us: <hi>O ye Galathians,</hi> Gal: 3.2. <hi>before whom Chriſt hath bin ſet out as crucifyed among your.</hi> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may be well applyed to the Sacraments, which doe ſo ſhew forth Chriſts death, that they deſcribe him crucifyed unto the ſight, and ſet him out unto the eye, that which the word declares him to the hearing. Now if there be any to whom the matter of the Goſpell may not be declared, if there be any to whom we may not, or cannot ſhew forth the death of Ieſus Chriſt, if there be any ſtand thus exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Church, that (without her mitigation) we may not tender to them the Covenant, it is they, and they alone can be debarred from the Sacrament. To this end we know the Sacraments are counted Signes and Seales, (and Seal indeed as Signes) now wherein is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45851:11"/>this but as they ſignify or repreſent the new Covenant to us, ratified, in the bloud of Chriſt? Underſtand it thus; A man covenants with a Landlord about a purchaſe for his children at ſuch a price, the price being paid, the bargain is eſtabliſht; This done, he requires a writing, wherein the whole agreement is expreſly declared; unto this writing the Lord puts to his Seale, to witneſſe the confirmation, and ſo it is deliver'd for his poſterity. Ieſus Chriſt does thus make a purchaſe for us, his death is the price he layes down to God for it; for conveyance of this purchaſe, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that is drawne is the Goſpell, and the Séale put to this writing, is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; both of which muſt goe, to make the publick Inſtrument firm, that is, to teſtifie the vatification of it, and ſo it is delivered for the uſe of the Church. More fully thus; A Prince (by interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Favourite) ſends forth a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Grace to Rebels, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laying downe their arms, and coming in to him, unto which he ſets his own Seal for their aſſurance. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciamation is the word of reconciliation preacht, which runs conditionally to all;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45851:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Seal annext, is the Sacrament; now can it be imagined there is any to whom the Proclamation belongs, without the Seale? Is not the Seal publick as the contents of it? And ſo will it not be plain, that as we offer the conditions thereof to any, ſo likewiſe may we, and muſt we the Seal (upon their deſire) to confirm them to come in, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto them? Thus we ſee the very nature of the Sacraments is as Seales to a Writing, to be but neceſſary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>To conclude this firſt reaſon, then let me adde force to it briefly in theſe foure conſiderations.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That we find that the Goſpell is to be preached to every creature, and a Baptizing them (which on the ſame ground includes this Sacrament with it) joyned as largely in the ſame Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>
                  <item>2. That as the Goſpell is to All, ſo it offers Chriſt freely; Now can any avouch, that a poor Soule may take Chriſt freely without qualifications (which is true in regard of any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent merit, ſo there be a preſent giving up himſelf to him ſincerely, as his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45851:12"/>☞ Lord and Saviour) and yet let none but ſuch as are qualified to their mind; be Admitted to receive him at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments? Is Chriſt offered as a free gift in the Word, and muſt we not come without our price and money to this Ordinance? Why, this is even as they conceive of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who being about to ſell our Saviour, went out to make his bargaine, at the Supper.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Goſpell-way is the beſt way to bring in Soules unto Chriſt. Let a Man be fully convinced of the free grace of God in Chriſt, his heart can ſtand it out no longer againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Now when the word is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Covenant opened, and the Seale too applyed, this Meſſage of reconciliation comes in its ful vertue for the working this conviction, and faith unto Salvation.</item>
                  <item>4. That the Goſpell is a peaceable Goſpell, an Embaſſy of Peace, now how ſhall this peace be kept, if where it comes, it goes to making ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at this Ordinance? may a poor Soule ſay, O Lord Ieſus Chriſt, though I cannot lay claim unto thee as a Saint, Ican as a ſinner (I meane as a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45851:12"/>ſinner), whom thou cameſt to ſave; and ſhall none but Saints apparent be: ſuffered to come unto him hither? In a word, is the Goſpell peaceable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, free, univerſall? What is the Goſpell but a declaring Chriſt Crucified? and what is the Sacrament in the Matter and Contents of it, but the very ſame? if <hi>Paul</hi> can tell us what it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26: therefore there ought to be a free admiſſion to it, as to the Goſpell.†</item>
               </list>
               <p>My ſecond Reaſon I draw from the nature of the viſible Church; The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church is a number of ſuch as make profeſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo are Saints by calling, whatſoever they are in truth, the eſſentiall marks whereof (whereby it ſubſiſts as viſible) is the Preaching of the Word, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments; now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Men will be ſo bold to diveſt our mixt Congregations (and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all <hi>England</hi> formerly) of the name of the viſible Church, they cannot take from us one of its eſſentiall notes, in the free uſe of this Ordinance. This Reaſon may have invincible ſupport from Chriſts owne doctrine and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45851:13"/>Firſt, His doctrine in thoſe parables of the little and great fiſhes in one net; The good and bad called to one feaſt, as before; The Chaffe and Wheat in one Barne; Eſpecially, the Tares and Corne in one field, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. The Kingdom of Heaven is compared to that Field, and the Field (ſayes Chriſt) is the World, that is, the Kingdom of Heaven in the World, or the viſible Church cleerly in its Ordinances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of two ſorts of profeſſors, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and the true beleever; which muſt grow together without ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (even when the Servants diſcerning the Tares, come and tell their Lord of them) untill the day of Iudgment; now who dare go to anticipate that day, and enter upon the Throne of Chriſt? Lord is it thy mind we ſhould make the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration between theſe Tares and Wheat at one of thine Ordinances? I can never beleeve then, thou wouldeſt have left this parable ſo undoubtedly ſet forth in the Goſpell. Secondly, His example, not only in the frequent converſe with Publicans and Sinners, but even in this very thing we find him at the Paſſeover, and his owne Supper
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45851:13"/>with <hi>Iudas.</hi> The three firſt Evangeliſts bring him in expreſſe with the reſt at Table, and as for <hi>John,</hi> who wrote after the other, the truth is, (which many doe not, or will not know) he finding this Supper fully ſet forth by them already, as in other things, he ſays nothing of it. St <hi>Luke</hi> is moſt evident, 22. <hi>v.</hi> 21. where we read after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, Chriſt ſays, <hi>Yet behold the hand ☜ of him that betrayeth me is at the Table.</hi> Yet, as if he ſhould ſay, Alas, though this <hi>Iudas</hi> partakes with us in this very Supper, yet will he go and betray me. So that at the ſame time, when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly declares, what a reprobate or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill he was (that this may not be poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhifted off with his being a cloſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite) he not only waſht his feet with the reſt at a Supper a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which <hi>Iohn</hi> only mentions, but here communicates with him both of the Paſſeover and of this Supper. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of which fact has ever appeared ſo fully to the Church, that this alone has been ground ſufficient, to deduce their right of free admiſſion; and what need more indeed be urged, but that men when they are willing not to ſee, will
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45851:14"/>let any hand, put over their eyes, be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to blind them?</p>
               <p>My third Reaſon I take from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtian Communion, and Church-fellowſhip, which ought to be in Charity, in humility, without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one, eſteeming others better than themſelves, with the like in many places; eſpecially in the Miniſter, who is to be gentle to all, ſuffering the evill (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to win them by this free way to Repentance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. And how impoſſible is this, if we muſt go to cenſuring of mens worthineſs &amp; unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, preferring our ſelves, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting others? the ready way to nothing but heart-burnings, and diviſions, as we have too ſad experience already in moſt Congregations. To Give weight to this, remember three paſſages of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, Luke</hi> 18. I need not relate it, only I beſeech you lay it to heart whether there be not ſomething (at leaſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.22.) of the Phariſees, I thank God I am not like this Publican, in the turning away poor ſinners from this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. There is a proud Phariſaiſme,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45851:14"/>I will not accuſe any of this, the very latchets of whoſe holy deſires (erring after a likeneſſe here to the Church in Heaven) I may not be worthy; and there is a ſtrict Phariſaiſme, as the Iews that were ſo rigid in their Sabbath, Chriſt was faine to rebuke and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate them in it; Of ſuch a rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ☜ as this, I cannot but moſt ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully complayne in thoſe, that will not allow a free Communion. O my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our rebuke the humour of theſe times that is amiſſe, and moderate the zeale of all ſuch men, leſt by their placing a peculiar and ſuperſtitious holineſſe on this Ordinance, they quite invert the charitable uſe of it, and withhold the legacy thou haſt left thy people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That paſſage in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. When they murmured at him for eating with ſinners; <hi>The whole,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>need not the Phyſitian, but the ſick, I come not to call the righteous, but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> O ſweet Ieſus, did'ſt thou alive offer thy ſelf and company to the very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Publicans, and never caſtedſt out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that came to thee, and ſhall we take ſtomach that thou art now thus offered at this Sacrament!</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45851:15"/>
               <p>The third place is in <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. When ſome ſevere Iews had brought a woman taken in Adultery, accuſing her by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſhe ſhould be ſtoned, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid unto them, <hi>Let him that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin himſelf, caſt the firſt ſtone at her.</hi> My Brethren, ſo ſay I, let a man examine his own heart, and if he does not find himſelf conſcious of the ſame corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let him have a cenſure to caſt out others; for my part I muſt profeſſe the ſerious acknowledgment of mine owne vileneſſe, makes me afraid at heart to turne away others, but I have learnt with Chriſt (<hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2.) to pity them (as a fellow ſinner) by my owne infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>☞ My fourth Reaſon will ariſe from the vanity, formality, impoſſibility of ſelecting people to this Ordinance. Look up but to the heart of all theſe ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they come to nothing; For put the caſe, you will have a gathered compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I pray who do you account indeed to be fit and worthy receivers? If not all that make profeſſion as we do mixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then, thoſe only that have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, and are true believers: Well, but how will you be able to know
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45851:15"/>them? The heart of man is deceitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, who can know it? And if we can hardly diſcover our owne hearts, how ſhall we ever diſcerne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? So that all will come but to thoſe that have the fayreſt ſhew, thoſe that ſeeme ſuch, and you cannot be ſecured, but there may and will be ſome hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and ſo this true partaking as all one body and one blood, in ſuch an unmixt Communion as you pretend, vaniſhes, and there can be no ſuch matter; But now if men ſtand here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a formall purity, and will have the outward pureſt Church they can, they go to ſeparating againe, and never leave ſeparating and ſeparating (as we have dayly Teſtimony) till they are quite ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another; Even as in the peeling of an Onion, where you may peele and peele, till you have brought all to nothing, unleſſe to a few tears perchance, with which the eyes of good men muſt needs runne over in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>My fift Reaſon I gather from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Service of God; If all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſhip lies in common, it is an intrenchment upon the common liberty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45851:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>to put an encloſure upon the Sacrament. Are all the commands of God univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, why not <hi>doe this</hi> alſo? if an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man cannot doe any thing that is acceptable to Chriſt, but it turnes to ſin (<hi>non per ſe, ſed per pravam diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ſubjecti</hi>) and ſo is Damnable, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.9. and yet he is to doe his endeavour, and not to be excluded nevertheleſſe ftom any duty; why muſt there needs be an excluſion here upon feare of the like ſin and condemnation? Let our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents anſwer, why doe you allow a <hi>Syntax</hi> in the whole ſervice of God beſides; and bring in a <hi>Quae genus</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomalaes</hi> and <hi>Heteroclites,</hi> onely at this ☞ Ordinance? Let ſome of our Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians anſwer, how can wee admit of Children as Members of the viſible Church, being born of Chriſtian parents, unto Baptiſme, and yet turne away the parents of thoſe Children from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? Thoſe that have gone about to anſwer this, had better happly have ſaid nothing, for our free courſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and a deniall of this, is ſuch a Seame-rent, as will never be handſomly drawn up, though ſtitcht together; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe in yielding the one, they have granted the other.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45851:16"/>
               <p>My ſixt Reaſon I lay down from my innocency in thus doing: 1. I doe but my duty: 2. I have no power to turn away any: 3. I hope the beſt, of all: 4. I know God can turne the worſt even at this ordinance if he pleaſe: 5. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour my utmoſt <hi>de jure</hi> that all come prepared: 6. I humbly confeſſe all our ſins (as <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) deſiring true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a pardon for all our omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſo laſtly, I venture the iſſue all on God, knowing that his ordinances are a ſweet ſavour unto him, whether we are ſaved or periſh by them.</p>
               <p>I might adde here more conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very preſſing, from the command, and good of comming; from the evill of omitting this ordinance. For the good of comming; The Sacrament is a meanes, and a pledge; a means as well to receive grace, as a pledge to aſſure us thereof: Now ſuppoſe a poor ſoule wants grace, whether ſhall he come but to the means of receiving it? The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are as the Baths, there are many come to the Bath, that are never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it, yet as they are means of health they are open and free for all, to come, and make experience of them.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45851:19"/>may be ſaid, is not like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all ſcruples, which are ſo much faſtened on their Conſciences, thinking they have holyneſſe on their ſide; we are to goe unto the Throne of Grace, to pray the Lord to give us his Spirit of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination to direct us in this truth, which is able alone to convince and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us. And for me, if I deliver what is not conſonant to the holy Word, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lord to blot out my Sermon, with my ſin, that none of his Little ones may be offended by it; but if it be the mouth of Truth too much kept in ſilence, delivering nothing but the very doctrine and practiſe of Chriſt himſelfe and his Apoſtles, (as one of his weakeſt ſervants does heartily beleeve) I hope the Lord will give a bleſſing on it, and ſend it out as a light into your hearts, to diſcover thoſe ſubtilties of Sathan, whereby he would obſtruct your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the uſe of this Ordinance.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, that the exerciſe of this conſiſts in Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, That the want thereof in the right inſtitution is to be beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p>But by the way of ſatisfaction, I Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, this Objection is grounded merely on falſe ſurmiſes about Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being removed as the fewell from the fire, it will go out of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It ſurmiſes this Church-diſcipline to lye in a ſuſpenſion from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if Excommunication were but an Excommunion.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore know, that theſe Church cenſures are puniſhments upon ſcandalous perſons (after a legall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction) whereby they are debarred from Chriſtian ſociety in generall (leſt they leven others by their example) for els what is it to keep a prophane perſon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45851:20"/>from the Sacrament, but to gratifie him, who never intended, at leaſt never ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to come thither?

                  <p n="2">2 It ſurmiſeth the inſtitution of this power to be in reference onely to the Ordinances, to keepe them pure and holy, as if the Sacrament eſpecially would be defiled otherwiſe to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore further know the ends of theſe Church cenſures, that they concern not thoſe that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Ordinance, but are uſed in reference only to Offenders, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be kept in awe, and brought to Repentance.

Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtinguiſh finally, between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Keys as Acts of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the uſe of the Ordinances as Acts of Worſhip; and though the Keys may have ſome diſpoſing power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the outward order of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet is there no allyance in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of one another, one is in one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other is in another; even as the Acts of the Aſſizes may have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on, but they have no relation to the nature of your private occupations.</p>
                  <p>In duties there may be a double rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a relation of ingrediency, as faith has to prayer, without which be in it, it cannot be effectuall; or a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſubſerviency, as the Law has to the Goſpell, in being preparatory to it; now there is no ſuch relation at all, not only no ingrediency as a part of it, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45851:21"/>even no eſſentiall ſubſerviency, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance betweene Excommunication and the Sacrament.

So that I judge there is no more reaſon for one upon this ground to ſay, I will not go to the Communion, becauſe there is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, than for one to ſay, we have here no Iuſtices or Seſſions, we have no Magiſtrate in this Town to look to people in their dealings, therefore (becauſe it is better that we had) we will not live here, but hold it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawfull to follow our ordinary vocation.

                  <list>
                     <item>☞ 1. There is no duty a naturall man can perform rightly, ſo that moſt men are wholly uncapable to hear, to pray, or come to any Ordinances, where Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45851:22"/>are to be acted and received, as well as at this Sacrament, but I hope that will not exclude them therefore from all, and give them a writ of Eaſe to doe nothing; I wonder grave men ſhould beat the ayre thus with a Feather.</item>
                     <item>2. I ſay to every man, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe what he ſhould and ought to doe, he muſt ſtill endeavour to doe what he can. The infufficiency of any debtor (incurr'd through his owne fault) does not diſcharge his Bond, but he is to pay what he can; it is every mans doing leſſe than he can, that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him at the laſt day, ſay Divines; ſo ſay I, Let every man doe what he can ſtill, and this is plain Divinity.</item>
                     <item>3. There may be a difference between a worthy Receiver, and a Receiving worthily; As a poor man (ſayes <hi>Pemble</hi>) though but unworthy to ſit there, may carry himſelf very worthily at the Kings Table. In this caſe therefore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art, doe thou labour thy beſt to prepare thy heart, and if after thy examination, thou judgeſt thy ſelfe but unworthy, let thy humbled ſoule come and ſay nevertheleſſe, Lord, if I am unworthy, whither ſhall I goe to make
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45851:22"/>me worthy? Is it not to thee my kinde Saviour, that has an invitation (<hi>Come ye laden</hi>) for the pooreſt ſinner? It is true, many count me but as a Dog, Lord I confeſſe I am no better in my own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; But let even this poor Dog eat of the crummes of thy Table. If I neglect my duty, I certainly offend thee, if I come Lord, I doe but humbly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on thy mercy.</item>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45851:26"/>may be conſidered in their nature, and in their uſe: In their nature, I take them to be Gods ſeals only, as primarily ſignifying his grace, and ſhewing forth Chriſt, though in the uſe and effect they are to be mans too, as ſecondarily he is reciprocally to believe, and engage himſelf unto God: (<hi>Sacramenta noſtra accipimus ex manu dei, &amp; nobis ſunc ſigna gratiae primo, ſecundarie obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis &amp; profeſſionis noſtrae: Paraus in Loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praedict</hi>) In the notion they are mans ſeals, we may conceive the Sacraments Seals of Faith, for Faith is the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant, and we ſeal to our Condition, ſo that as they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus indeed; they are ſeals of Faith, becauſe ſeals of the Covenant, which I ſtand upon: But as they are Gods ſeals, for the ſame reaſon they cannot be ſeals of Faith (but <hi>conſecutivè,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the effect to the Godly, to yeeld what may be expreſſively only) becauſe God ſeals not imaginably to our part of the Covenant which is Faith, but to his owne part, which is the promiſe, and ſo I call them ſeals of the Covenant or promiſe formally, and not of faith. Now I ſay cleerly, though an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45851:27"/>☞ man cannot receive the Sacrament, as a ſeale of his Faith, yet the Church can give it, as a ſeale of the Covenant; and though it wants its due effect on him, there is the right nature neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the Adminiſtration, though not a right uſe of it in the receiver; even as at the word, where there may be true preaching, and the nature of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, though the hearers apply it not as they ought, by faith. Look back to that only place <hi>Ra.</hi> 4. where it is ſaid Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is a ſeale, <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to receive it as a ſeale, which receiving includes Gods giving; ſo that we muſt look upon the Sacraments in the nature of them, as Gods ſeals from the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; who elſe durſt appoint ſuch things to ſignifie ſuch ſpirituall matters? &amp; as they are Gods ſeals they are ſet to his own word, and ſo can never be to a blanck while there is truth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and writing in the Goſpell. Now then the Sacraments being Gods ſeals certainly, in the inſtitution &amp; nature of them, if I ſhould deny them to be mans ſeals at all, there being not for it one tittle of Scripture, I ſhould quite remove the ſcruple from the hearts of men; but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45851:27"/>whereas (that I may not remove their care and duty too) I grant though in the nature of ſeals, they are Gods Seals, Gods own ſeals, ſeals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant only, yet in the uſe of ſeals and effect, they are to be mans ſeals alſo, ſeals to the Condition of our part, ſeals of faith, and ſo I cannot, I may not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the receivers wholly, but that they come abſurdly, ſet a ſeale to a blanke, and take the Sacrament in vaine (as it is to be their ſeale) if they come without Faith, and thoſe ſolemne engagements as God Requires of us; though I can fully acquit the Church herein, in her delivery of the ſigns on Gods part (as we are his Embaſſadors;) becauſe the Covenant by him ſtands ſealed to all whomſoever, and there can be no doubt of ſealing to a blanke I affirme, ſo long as the Promiſe or the Goſpell it ſelfe holds in force, the tenour whereof this Sacrament ſeals abſolutely to us. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it I ſay, marke me, not our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it; for that it ſeals not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely. The Sacrament is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſeale (the internall only of the Spirit can abſolutely give this intereſt to any) this outward ſeale, is ſet to Gods
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45851:28"/>outward copy of the Covenant, that is the word; now look what the word af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, the Sacrament ſeals, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms according to the tenor thereof, and no otherwiſe. Now the word ſpeaks not particularly of any mans ſingle intereſt, but generally it declares to all a common intereſt upon condition they beleeve; now as this intereſt is expreſt conditionally, ſo the Sacrament cannot ſeale to it but conditionally, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that tenor is expreſt; or rather let me ſay the Sacrament ſeals ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally (ſo I will expreſſe it) the truth of the Covenant freely to all, engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them unto it, and the intereſt or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Covenant, to every ſingle perſon, upon the terms, conditions, or tenor only of the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>I muſt profeſſe this in the Embrion has layn a long time in my apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and I cannot but be glad to find a piercing and godly man (I take him) whom the right conceiving of. this alone (he ſays) converted hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45851:28"/>we gather our aſſurance. Now to which of thoſe propoſitions (ſayes he) does the Sacrament ſeal? not to the minor as it is ſurmiſed, for no Scripture ſayes of any particular man he beleeves, and God ſeals to his own word not ours. Nor to the concluſion for the ſame reaſon. But to the major, which it abſolutely ſeales, as true to us, according to the tenour of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>

I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Divines doe uſually diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, of a Sacrament of Initiation, and Confirmation, ingeniouſly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting our new birth firſt to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and then our nouriſhment and encreaſe unto the Supper, and ſo they make a converting Ordinance of the Word, and Baptiſme (the laver and meanes of regeneration) a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one only, of this Sacrament; although I take a grant of the one, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45851:31"/>be a ſufficient <hi>medium</hi> to prove the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But under favour, unleſſe we take this only in regard of the viſible Church, into which, 'tis true, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme alone does incorporate us; we muſt underſtand it not after a rigid form of ſpeech, and Idiome of truth, but after a more ſolute and ingenuous concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that is, it is ſuch a notion as holds full enough to be handſomely ſpoken, but holds not ſo ſtrictly as to build ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments on it, otherwiſe the ingenuity thereof, will trip up their judgement. It is a rule therefore worthy here of our knowledge, that in divinity, we often give an indefinite denomination to things as they are moſt eminently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined; as for inſtance, in indifferent things (which are <hi>indifferentia ad u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>) when they incline more to evill in the uſe than to good (as many harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe recreations) we condemne them indefinitely as evill, though in ſome caſes they are warrantable: <hi>Ec.</hi> 3.4. And I may happily with right circumſtances lawfully uſe them. So whereas this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth more emminently incline to be, and is <gap reason="foreign">

And indeed this is true when it is taken in reſpect of the ſame perſons, whom we ſuppoſing to have been converted by the Word and Baptiſme already, the Supper is, and can be only a confirming Ordinance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them without queſtion. But as for others, who we conceive, not yet converted, and ſo humbly coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for converſion, I doubt not, as there is no Scripture to the contrary; ſo there is no reaſon, but as the Word and Baptiſme do confirme, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; ſo may this Sacrament convert, as confirme, according as God gives forth his grace to the Condition of the Receivers.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore an error (to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer directly) in this Objection about the nature of the Sacrament (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we have ſhewne) a viſible word holding forth Chriſt and the Covenant to the ſight, is converting, as the Goſpell doing the ſame to the hearing; for if the Centurion believed only by ſeeing Chriſt corporally on the Croſſe; if the contemplation of the Creature ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45851:32"/>ſight of miracles have been means, to ſome of their religion and converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we cannot doubt, but the eyes may much more ſpiritually inſtruct us here in the melting objects of Chriſts paſſion, redemption and tender mercies outwardly repreſented, ſeeing we hope the working of the ſpirit too, by virtue of an ordinance.</p>
                  <p>☞ Let the World Anſwer <hi>Pauls</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, To ſhew forth the death of Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For, put caſe, a morall man, taken for a good man, yet unregenerate, is, and cannot be refuſed to be, admitted hither: The man does his beſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf, and ſo comes; do wee thinke now, to ſuch a man the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is neceſſarily fruitleſſe, and can have no worke on him? then God help

Shall not his examination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, prayers, meditation, with all the Miniſters exhortations, be more ſolemnly conducing now, to worke grace in his heart, and to convert him (this being the way of the ſpirits moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) then the bare preaching of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?

                     <p n="1">1. Let us cleerly know, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and all Ordinances, are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and properly means of grace; It of converſion, or confirmation. For this grace we receive in the uſe of them, is that which converts ſome, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens others. Now then we come to this Sacrament, as the meanes to receive Gods grace, and this grace, which he diſtributes as a moſt wiſe God, works in every one, as his ſtate and need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted for their ſtrength and eſtabliſhment, and in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate for their converſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider what is converſion. There is an outward converſion from Heatheniſme, to the profeſſion of Chriſt; we doe not ſtand to ſay the the Sacrament is ſuch a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, as if Chriſt ſhould bid us go forth with this Sacrament, and convert the Nations, let this be imagined only of the word. But there is an inward effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45851:34"/>converſion of ſuch as outwardly profeſſe Chriſt, to the truth of grace in their hearts. Now how is the worke of grace (or true converſion) wrought through the word it ſelfe? Not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny active power it has <hi>per ſe,</hi> upon the Soule; but <hi>per modum objecti</hi> we ſay, and inſtrumentally; the object is propoſed or revealed, that is all the word does, and then it is the ſpirit that by illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the mind, and a touch upon the will, brings the heart to embrace the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whereby it is converted. Now is it not juſt thus likewiſe in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? This Sacrament ſhews forth Chriſt Crucified according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, who is the true object of Faith and Life, upon this the ſpirit of God draws the heart (by illumination and conviction) to embrace him upon thoſe terms he here is offered, inſomuch that experience can witneſſe that ſome are, and have been hereby converted. What difference is there imaginable betweene this converſion and at the Word? What a ſhift is it to ſay it is only At, and not By the Sacrament, when it is inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <hi>per modum objecti,</hi> as the Word? where I may ſay the ſame too as truly,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45851:34"/>that it is more properly At, than By, the Word it ſelf, there being no active ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue but of the ſpirit, in the one, or the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for this device of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being occaſionally, not intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally converting; There may be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall intention and ſubordinate; more primary, or ſecondary ends in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Though the word be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall converting Ordinance, we cannot deny but others may be ſubordinately alſo converting, as Prayer; why els doth the Church pray, <hi>Turne thou u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

To the purpoſe. Then
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45851:35"/>you will ſay the word ſhall be held forth to all as intended to convert them, but the Sacrament ſhall not, being not ſo intended in the Inſtitution: Be it ſo: It followes then, there muſt be no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance adminiſtred to thoſe that are not converted, but only that which is thus an intended converting Ordinance: Is this as you would have it? This is the very ground on which you ſtand: But harke ye, my Friend, I pray then what ſhall become of publick prayer &amp; other Ordinances in the Church, when the Word is the onely principally intended converting Ordinance out of queſtion? By this doctrine at one daſh you take away all other dutyes in our mixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: In what a caſe are you here brought? what can you invent? On neceſſity you muſt recant and confeſſe indeed, that Prayer and the like duties, though not principally, yet in a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate way are converting Ordinances, or means and helps of converſion; and upon that account you admit all to them: Now if you will doe ſo, then is the door as full open in this ſubordinate way too, for the Sacrament: If you will not, I beleeve the Sacrament will be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45851:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>contented to be ſhut out with ſuch good company, and deſires to fare no better, than her fellow-ordinances.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45851:36"/>Paſſeover, but the feet were to be ſhod then &amp; the like geſtures quite contrary. <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.11. But if (as ſome ſay) thoſe paſſages which noted their haſt out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> were not obligatory when they came to the Land of Reſt, yet ſo large a circumſtance as is here mention'd of <hi>Ioh.</hi> to be introduc'd of Chriſt at that time is not probable. See <hi>Io.</hi> 12.1. There Chriſt came to <hi>Bethanie</hi> ſix days before the Paſſeover, whereabouts he ſtayed that time (going ſometimes to the City to preach. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.17.19. and back again) it being neer the Mount of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,</hi> which he did then frequent. <hi>Luke 22.39.</hi> In this ſpace he rode to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> on an Aſſe, and came back at night. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.11. Now this night happily, or thereabouts, was this Supper <hi>John</hi> mentions, where <hi>Iudas</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sop, went from thence, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Prieſts, the Devill then putting it into his heart. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.1-4.

Now on the morrow, or two dayes after this, Chriſt went from this <hi>Bethany,</hi> again to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (which was ſome 2 myles thither) it being the day of the Paſſeover. [Whether Chriſt kept it the ſame night with the Iewes, I need not controvert, ſeeing he kept it certainly the firſt day of the Feaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.16. and the time when the Paſſeover was to be kill'd <hi>Lu.</hi> 22.7. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.12.] <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So that Chriſt forewarned his Diſciples twice of <hi>Iudas</hi> Treaſon, the night or two before, by giving him a Sop, with which the Devlll entred his heart at firſt, to ſet him upon his bargaine, and here at the time of his own Supper with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45851:37"/>a like <hi>Item</hi> again, by dipping his hand with him in the diſh, A like I ſay, not the ſame; for St. <hi>Iohns</hi> giving him the Sop is not the ſame thing, as not at the ſame time, with Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke's</hi> dipping in the ſame diſh.

Let us act with chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thoughts, and leave the ſucceſſe to God.

                     <p n="2">2. For the Receivers part, there is a double duty; A principall, <hi>Doe this:</hi> And an acceſſory, <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe.</hi> We are bound to come, and to come worthily; If a man failes in the one, and is not ſufficiently prepared; I dare not ſay, that muſt keep (I am ſure it will not excuſe) him from the other. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; thoſe dreadfull expreſſions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of Chriſts bloud, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation, are to make men take heed that they prepare themſelves and come worthily, but I cannot think they are to affright any man from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are <hi>3 Quaere's</hi> therefore, I will ſubmit here to further conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>☞ The firſt, Whether the very eating and drinking of an unworthy Receiver be damnation, that is, (to free ſome
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45851:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>weake mindes from fearfull thoughts) whether it be ſuch a ſinne, as makes a man guilty without repentance and Gods mercy, of Condemnation? And I conceive we muſt diſtingniſh between the very receiving, which is good; and the unworthineſſe, which makes the ſin onely. This unworthineſſe is in the Perſon, or in the Act: In the Perſon it conſiſts in his evill conſcience, which will condemn him whether he comes, or abſtaines from comming. Put caſe one receives not, and is unworthy, the guilt of his unworthineſſe lyes never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe upon him for that, it may be, more; for in this very refuſing, his own Conſcience condemns him, and God is greater than his Conſcience; whereas if he comes, it happily may excuſe him ſomething in not neglecting the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performance, not aggravate his condition; for though he failes in the inward, and that failing is ſin, yet that Act he does, makes him not more ſinfull for the doing, but he would have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more, to have failed in that too, and not have done it, Unworthineſſe in the act, conſiſts in obliquity, deficiency, or failing in the right manner of receiving,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45851:40"/>though the outward work it ſelf be not amiſſe. There is the matter of a duty and manner; As for the matter, every one can doe, in a Chriſtian deportment at the Table, but in the manner, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in Faith, Love, and other graces as we ought, this a naturall man cannot doe, and ſo he ſinnes in his duty. His very Act is not ſin, ſo far as he does doe in the matter it is good (not only <hi>ſub genere entis,</hi> but good in <hi>tanto ſub ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere morum</hi>) but this failing and ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the manner, is the evill, which as it cleaves unto, we may conceive, defiles the Act, and makes it lyable unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Now then my ſecond Quaere is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiving the Sacrament unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is otherwiſe damnable, then pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing unworthily; (whereof Chriſt ſays as much, <hi>Go and preach, he that beleeveth not, is damned, Mar.</hi> 16. <hi>I ohn</hi> 3.18. <hi>ipſo facto</hi> as much as heere) And if it be not, why upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as men go to prayer, to the word and other dutyes, though they cannot pray and hear worthily, they may not as well goe to the Sacrament? my thoughts are thus; It is a ſad <hi>Dilemma</hi> unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45851:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>men are in; If they pray, hear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they ſinne (not in what they doe, I conceive, but in what they not doe) by failing in the manner, their perſons being not acceptable: If they doe not pray, hear and receive, they ſin worſe and are impious. Now what muſt be done here? If there be a neceſſity of ſinning, of two evills the leaſt muſt be choſen: it is a leſſe evill to doe what we can, though the outward matter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> be done, than to fail in matter and manner too, wholly caſting off the care of God. But if that axiome be true, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo anguſtiatur ad peccandum,</hi> there is no caſe wherein a man is neceſſitated to ſin, (and ſo that ſaying <hi>Of two Evills,</hi> muſt be taken alwayes <hi>de malo poenae</hi> not <hi>culpoe, Rom.</hi> 3.8.) then it is more clear, Every man muſt come and do the beſt he can, which if he doth, happily he ſhall not ſin (at leaſt ſo far, he does not) and God may bleſſe his endeavours, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benti dabitur,</hi> whereas if he neglects, he ſinneth without queſtion, this being <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum per ſe,</hi> the other <hi>per accidens</hi> onely. I will be hold therefore to diſtinguiſh: There may be a profane, preſumptuous comming to an Ordinance, or a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45851:41"/>comming in conformity to Gods Worſhip; though it is better not to come, than to come in a prophane way, this being rebellion and ſin in the fact; yet I ſay clearly, it is better to come in a Chriſtian way, though but in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformity to Gods ſervice, then altogether to neglect it; which being granted and practiſed of all in other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I think it but a begging the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to deny it in this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>My third Quaere is, Whether an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man conceiving himſelfe not worthy, muſt never come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for fear of eating his damnation. And herein my thoughts are apt to run comparatively on the word; The word ſets forth Chriſt on the termes of Faith and new obedience, that is the Goſpell rightly adminiſtred, whatſoever effect it hath on the hearers; Now it is their part indeed to receive and apply it by Faith, if they doe not, it pronounceth them damned; Thus the Sacrament like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhews forth Chriſt unto the ſight; and for the Churches part ſhe is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and offer him to all, however he is received: Now the Receivers, 'tis true, in the like manner again are to receive
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45851:41"/>in Faith, as they ought to doe: If they receive unworthily as the word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, this ſeal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> their damnation. Now a man will ſay, if the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth my damnation, ſo long as I am an unworthy hearer, I will not goe thither, I ſhall but heare my damnation; but I ſay you muſt goe thither, you lye in a damned ſtate already, and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary this damnation ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon you, to awake you out of your ſecurity in it, that by the terrours of Conſcience you may be driven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be converted; ſo the word is good in it ſelf, and the ſavour of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while it damns a man, if he uſefully receive it: So ſay I of the Sacrament, it is good in its nature, it is appointed for our good, and ſo we are to come unto it, as a means of grace; but if it acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſeals to any man his damnation, it is through his own unworthineſs, and he is then to make the ſame uſe of it, as of the damning word, that laying to heart the horror of his ſinne, in being guilty of the bloud of Chriſt, he may be provoked thereby to flie to Ieſus Chriſt, for a merit of his bloud to waſh away his guilt of it; and having received ſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45851:42"/>many ſeals of his damnation, he may be forced to the Lamb who alone is able to open all thoſe ſeals, by pardoning his ſins, and ſo to turne the ſavour of death unto life, and to make even damnation it ſelf (ſuch is the power of his grace) ſubſervient to his converſion and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſumme up this. If comming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily makes a man guilty of Chriſts blood, by powring it out in vaine, what ſhall an open refuſing deſerve, that even tramples upon it in the deſpiſing this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance?</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45851:44"/>Sacrament with a wicked man is ſin it ſelf, or makes it the ſin, or us more guilty of the ſin, becauſe we ought to have admoniſhed them, and laboured their excommunication: no, this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ours is the ſin by it ſelf, and the coming is our duty: God forbid that I ſhould think, if I do ſin in omitting one thing, that I muſt not therefore goe to do my duty in another. Becauſe the leaven is not purged out muſt there be no lumpe? this was, I may humbly ſay, a too overly ſurpriſe of godly Mr. <hi>Burroughs.</hi>

                        <hi>Rep. But you will ſay more obviouſly,</hi> Are not all ignorant and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons Swine and Dogs, to be rejected and kept from the Pearls and holy things of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</head>
                     <p>I anſwer, I dare not ſay ſo; though I ſee what intereſt lies at ſtake, which may ſoon fancy a Chriſtian convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, into a Divine neceſſity,</p>
                     <p>For Firſt, This is <hi>Petitio principii</hi> and if you ſpeak indefinitely, my proofs aſſure the contrary.</p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45851:44"/>
                     <p>Secondly, I place a great diſtance between an unfitnes to come unto the Sacrament as in other duties <hi>(Let a Man examine himſelf)</hi> and being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The keeping of any cannot be pretended to, without power in our unelderd Congregations, it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a power not of order but of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Men may be Dogs and Swine, either in the courſe of their lives, or in the publick eſteem of the Church; now in our Miniſteriall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we are to look on men as they are in the Churches eſteem; and may not account or deal with them as Dogs, (as we cannot execute an arrant thiefe) untill they are juridically cenſured to be ſuch, by lawfull authority.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To ſpeak particularly: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ignorant, I dare not judge ſo rigorouſly; The 5 <hi>Hev.</hi> 2. comes neer my heart; there are many ſorts of ignorance, the caſe whereof may need inſtruction moſtly, not cenſure. For the ſcandalous we know there muſt be admonition firſt, twice or thrice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15.16. And then if they continue
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45851:45"/>obſtinate (not elſe) and are notorious, an Excommunication is granted. <hi>verſe</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. yet <hi>I</hi> cannot finde any where (unleſſe I look without the book) that this is merely in reference to the Sacrament, but from Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in generall; at leaſt in the primary nature thereof, though I will yield much by way of indulgence, unto the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wiſedome, according to the ancient practiſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; the ſeverall ſpecies or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees whereof I muſt leave unto more learned Rabbies; And as to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent writ of ſuſpenſion in hand, which men would have a middle thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Admonition and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I muſt make my returne truly, <hi>Non eſt inventa, in baliva noſtra.</hi> I ſpeak it with reverence to wiſer judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who may allow as prudent, in the way of Diſcipline, what they will not enforce upon the Conſcience, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in our worſhip.</p>

                     <hi>10.</hi> The laſt Objection is from thoſe ſeverall Texts that are alleged for a ſeparation from Wicked perſons.</head>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:45851:45"/>
                  <p>Vnto all which I anſwer briefly, and (I conceive with ſubmiſſion) fully; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from wicked men is either in regard of their ſinnes, or their perſons; In regard of their ſinnes, it conſiſts in departing from their evill courſes; In regard of their perſons, it is either in caſe of common familiarity, or in caſe of Excommunication. Now it is certaine we muſt ſeparate,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from all wicked men in their ſins and evill courſes, this is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we grant that we muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate alſo from them in common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, taking heed of intimacy and keeping them company, leſt we be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their ſin, by infection or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance with them.</p>
                  <p>☞ But Thirdly, I affirme there is no Scripture commands our ſeparation from them in the Sacrament, or any of Gods publick Ordinances, unleſs in caſe of Excommunication; which alone can debarre any from Church-communion.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ſenſe you muſt take theſe Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20.21. Theſe <hi>Corinths</hi> did well to come to the Lords Table, their ſin was only in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45851:46"/>partaking with Idolls. ſoe 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. to the end, where they are rebuk'd for joyning in the ſame ſin of Idolatry. If you underſtand this, <hi>Be not unequally yokt,</hi> of Marriage, compare it with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13.14. There the beleeving wife muſt in no wiſe ſeparate from her Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell husband, here ſhe muſt come out &amp; be ſeperate, how can this be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled but that ſhe may have communion with the perſon in what is Lawfull, and yet be ſeparate from him in his wayes, that are evill? You may adde happily in this firſt ſenſe. <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.19. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6. All which texts are hereby an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that though indeed they doe command a ſeparation from the wicked; it is from them in their ſins, not from joyning with them in doing our duty.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond ſenſe, you may take 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. to the 12. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Rom:</hi> 16 17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. 2 <hi>Io.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.24.25. and it may be 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3 10 and ſo theſe Scriptures are likewiſe anſwer'd which do further for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us the wickeds familiarity as their ſins, not a bare accompanying with any in Gods Ordinances.</p>
                  <div type="reply">

                     <head>
                        <hi>Rep. But you will ſay,</hi> If I muſt decline a wicked man, ſo as not to eat with him, (which I interpret by our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converſation) how much more muſt I decline him at this Sacrament?</head>
                     <p>I Anſwer, this is clear fallacy, I am ſorry to ſee many graveld in their minds at it; as if there were any force in this, I muſt not be ſuch a mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon companion, therefore I muſt not goe to Church with him: Wee muſt know, Arguments from the leſſe to the greater, muſt be in things of the ſame kind and nature; Now it is one thing to eat at home, an indifferent action, where I am left to my own arbitration and muſt not chuſe evill, and another to eat at the Sacrament, which I am bound unto as a piece of the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p>In the third ſenſe I take <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. to the 9. where the whole Communion or Life of Chriſtians, is compared to an unleavened Feaſt (from which that perſon was to be excluded in generall) without peculiar mention (as ſome would have it) of the Sacrament
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45851:47"/>you may reckon hither many places <hi>Io.</hi> 9.22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. &amp;c. In which caſe only when excommunicated, the matter is granted. And thus I am apt to think, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9.10.11. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6.14: 2 <hi>Io.</hi> 10. &amp;c. quoted in the ſecond ſenſe before, if ſtrictly taken, ſtands in full force onely. As for <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. which properly concerns Admonition, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. which, (with ſome cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious precepts of the Law) In the words, are much applyed for the ſcaring of many conſciences, I muſt appeale to other judgements when they are well weighed, whether in their proper ſenſe and importance they are not many leagues off this peculiar buſineſſe of the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude with 4 Wiſhes:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. I Wiſh we had a Government e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht in the Church, the neereſt in Chriſtian prudence that may be, to the word of God:</item>
                        <item>2. I Wiſh the duty of Fraternall correption, a watching over, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing one another in love were better known and practiſed amongſt us.</item>
                        <item>3. I Wiſh that men would look more into their own conſciences, and leave
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45851:47"/>the judging of others ſpirits, hearts, and reines alone, to the judgement ſeat of Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>4. ☞ I Wiſh, though there may be ſome judging by the fruits, that wiſe religious men would be more cautious of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing theſe ſeparations in the viſible Church, ſeeing upon the ſame ground that you goe to gather a Church out of my mixt congregation another will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſeparation out of your Church; and ſo continue (as I have intimated from our ſad experience) an endleſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating, untill this firſt ſeparation ſhall in a few years be able to take up the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Greateſt Grandmother, unto thoſe many ſchiſms ſhe ſhall ſee iſſuing, as her naturall offſpring, out of her own bowels, Riſe up Daughter, goe to thy Daughter, for thy Daughters Daughter has a Daughter; for this ſeparations ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration has a ſeparation.</item>
